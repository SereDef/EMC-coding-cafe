Welcome to the **EMC Programming cCafé**! 

We are a (self-organised) group of bio-medical researchers based at Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam, NL), who try to support each other with all sort of "coding matters". We talk about programming, scripting, software configs, visualization, stats and opens science challenges in general.

We meet (usually bi-monthly) to share knowledge, "pair program", review each others code and, sometimes, just to have a chat.

We are part of a larger [network of programming cafes](https://github.com/code-cafes-nl) (chek it out!)
