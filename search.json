We talk about programming, scripting, software configs, visualization, stats and opens science challenges in general.\nWe meet (usually bi-monthly) to share knowledge, “pair program”, review each others code and, sometimes, just to have a chat.\nWe are part of a larger network of programming cafes (chek it out!)\n\n☕️ Join us!\nEverybody (all experiece levels and research interests) is welcome to join us!\nShoot us an email.\n\n\n🫱🏽‍🫲🏻 Code of Conduct\nParticipants are expected to follow these guidelines:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language.\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.\nGracefully accept constructive criticism.\nFocus on what is best for the community.\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members.\n\n\n\n💃🏻🕺🏽 contact list: who are we, what do we want\nIn this document we try to keep track of the people involved, their expertese and which things we would like to learn."
